👋 Hi, I’m Isabela Arauz - Pronouns: she/her/hers
Where I am currently: Sunnyvale ☀️, California.
- My Masters in Science (in Earth, Marine and Environmental Sciences from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) involved doing research about coastal flooding, remote sensing 🛰️, SAR imagery and the current and past factors potentially involving the formation of "Ghost Forests".
      If you are interested in learning more about my research, you can find it in here: https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/dissertations/cj82kp671

- I am also interested in learning more about Sustainability, and Machine Learning 🌱 . 
- Currently, I am working on a paper draft to publish the map I developed about Inundation Frequency for the Mid Atlantic Coast of the United States with the Global Hydrology Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
- ⚡ Offline: I have two mini-daschunds at home who I love to play with, I enjoy painting portraits with oils and acrylics, making cups and small sculptures at a close-by pottery studio and I enjoy learning about app development involving AI features to facilitate tasks for organizing and managing large datasets like my list favorite clothing stores and coffee places (yes, I have over a 1000 of those places).
