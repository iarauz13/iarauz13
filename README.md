- 👋 Hi, I’m Isabela Arauz - Pronouns: she/her/hers
- My Masters in Science (in Earth, Marine and Environmental Sciences from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) involved doing research about coastal flooding, remote sensing 🛰️, SAR imagery and the current and past factors potentially involving the formation of "Ghost Forests".
      If you are interested in learning more about my research, you can find it in here: https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/dissertations/cj82kp671
- Additionally, I am also interested in learning more about Sustainability, and Machine Learning 🌱 . 
- I’m currently working on developing an Inundation Frequency Map for the Mid Atlantic Coast of the United States with the Global Hydrology Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a pet-lover, I enjoy painting portraits with oils and acrylics, and I enjoy learning about app development involving AI features to facilitate tasks for organizing and managing large datasets.
