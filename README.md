I am a pet-lover and creative enthusiast! When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me:
* 🐶 Playing with my two mini-dachshunds at home.
* 🎨 Painting portraits with oils and acrylics.
* 🏺 Throwing cups and small sculptures at a local pottery studio.
* 📱 Learning app development with AI features (building tools to organize my list of 1000+ favorite clothing stores and coffee spots!).
